# Hello World: First Java Program  

## About:
I will be documenting my Java Journey through GitHub Repositories to showcase my advancement in the language. As I went through learning JavaScript, Node and React, I found myself regretting not documenting and showing my advancement through the language. I aim to change that while I learn Java, and hope that once I become a great programmer and developer, I can look back and be reminded of my roots. 

Each ReadMe will include this about section, as well as a brief description of the repository, what it does and why it's important.

## Description:
Welcome to my first Java program here! This repository is to demonstrate a simple print out statement to write `Hello World!` to the console. Print statements are extremely useful. They help us relay information to the console, which is helpful during debugging. This is a great place to begin learning Java, and I wanted to show my first Java Code.
